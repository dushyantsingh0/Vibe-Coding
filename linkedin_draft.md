# LinkedIn Post Drafts for Dev-Pulse (Powered by Antigravity & Gemini 3.0)

Here are updated options that highlight the AI-native workflow and the "Vibe Coding" experience.

## Option 1: The "Future of Coding" (Best for viral reach)

**I just "Vibe Coded" my latest project, Dev-Pulse, using Google's new Antigravity agent and Gemini 3.0.** 🤯

The way we build software is changing. It's no longer just about typing syntax; it's about directing intelligence.

With **Antigravity** (powered by **Gemini 3.0**), I wasn't just writing code—I was pair-programming with a super-intelligent architect. We built **Dev-Pulse**, a full-stack blogging platform, in record time.

**The Stack & The Vibe:**
✨ **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite (Glassmorphism UI)
⚡️ **Backend**: Express + Drizzle ORM + Neon
🧠 **The Brain**: Gemini 3.0 (Antigravity)

The "Vibe Coding" flow is real. I focused on the creative direction, the UX, and the "feel" of the app, while the agent handled the heavy lifting of refactoring, skeleton loaders, and database migrations.

Check out the build below. This is what the future feels like. 👇

## Option 2: The "Dev-Pulse" Product Launch (Best for showcasing the app)

**Introducing Dev-Pulse: A next-gen blogging platform built with AI.** 🚀

I wanted to build something that felt fast, fluid, and premium. So I teamed up with **Antigravity** (Google's advanced coding agent) and **Gemini 3.0** to make it happen.

We "Vibe Coded" this from the ground up. The result?
✅ **Instant Interactions**: Optimistic UI for likes/comments.
✅ **Glassmorphism Design**: A UI that pops.
✅ **Solid Architecture**: Built on React 19 and Drizzle ORM.

The collaboration with Gemini 3.0 was seamless. It understood the *intent* behind the code, not just the syntax. It helped me implement complex patterns like decoupled data fetching and skeleton screens without breaking flow.

Dev-Pulse is live. Let me know what you think!

## Option 3: Short & Hype (Best for a quick update)

**Vibe Coding with Gemini 3.0 is a cheat code.** ⚡️

Just wrapped up **Dev-Pulse**, my new full-stack project. 

Built using **Antigravity** (the new agentic workflow from DeepMind). We crushed the implementation of:
- React 19 & Vite
- Drizzle ORM & Neon DB
- A buttery smooth Glassmorphism UI

The speed from idea to execution with this stack is unreal.
